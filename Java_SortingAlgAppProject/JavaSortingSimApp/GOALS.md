# App Purpose:
- Generates random unsorted list.
- User selects type of Sorting algorithm.
- User presses button to sort that list.
- Output: User is given sorted list and elapsed sorting time.
- Every recorded sorting time is stored on list.
- The fastest sort time recorded will be labled.


# Dev To Do:
1.) Implement Sorting Algorithm Classes
2.) Implement Timer that records total sort time of each algorithm
3.) GUI Implementation
4.) Exception Handling
