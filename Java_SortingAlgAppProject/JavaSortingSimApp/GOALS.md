# App Purpose Summary:
- Generates random unsorted list.
- Has a selected algorithm sort it.
- Generates time complexity data for user to examine algorithm's speed.

## Planned Features For App:
# Basic use case scenario: For none comp sci major users.
- INPUTS:
- User selects type of Sorting algorithm.
- User inputs size of lists that will be sorted.
- User Inputs the seed used to generate lists.
- User presses "Begin Sort" button to sort that list.
- OUTPUT: 
- User is given sorted list and elapsed sorting time.
- Every recorded sorting time is stored on list.
- The fastest sort time recorded will be labled.

# Advanced Use Case: For software developers
- INPUTS:
- User selects, "Time Complexity Testing" Mode.
- User selects algorithm
- User creates "trails rounds" to test the algorithm
- OUTPUTS:
- Data is sorted and the algorithm is timed.
- The times measured for each rounds are stored in Table for user to see.
- User can Export data into an excel or other table sheet file.

# Dev To Do:
1.) Implement Sorting Algorithm Classes
2.) Implement Timer that records total sort time of each algorithm
3.) GUI Implementation
4.) Exception Handling
